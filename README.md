📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing global food production trends from 1961 to 2023 using Power BI.
It provides interactive dashboards and insights on the production of major crops and fruits across various countries and regions.
The goal is to make raw agricultural data easier to understand, visualize, and use for decision-making in areas like food security, trade, and agricultural planning.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze global production trends of major crops and fruits (1961–2023).

Identify top-producing regions and commodities.

Create interactive dashboards using Power BI.

Generate insights for policymakers, researchers, and agribusiness sectors.

Present findings through reports and visualization-based storytelling.

🧩 Tools & Technologies Used

Power BI Desktop – Data Visualization & Dashboard Development

Microsoft Excel – Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Kaggle Dataset – Global Food Production (1961–2023)

GitHub – Version Control & Documentation

🗂️ Dataset Details

Source: Kaggle – World Food Production Dataset (1961–2023) 

Records: ~11,912 rows × 24 columns

Coverage: 62 years (1961–2023)

Commodities: Rice, Wheat, Maize, Tea, Coffee, Grapes, Apples, Bananas, Oranges, etc.

📈 Dashboard Features

KPI Cards – Total production metrics (wheat, rice, tea, etc.)

Area Chart – Annual trends for cereals (wheat, maize, rice).

Gauge Chart – Tea production overview.

Line Chart – Coffee production trends by region.

Ribbon Chart – Fruit distribution across continents.

Funnel Chart – Top fruits by global production volume.
